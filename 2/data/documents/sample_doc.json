        "heading": "Introduction to RAG",
        "content": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI framework that combines the strengths of both retrieval-based and generative models. RAG works by first retrieving relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base and then using these retrieved texts as additional context for a language model to generate responses."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Key Advantages",
        "content": "The key advantage of RAG is that it allows language models to access external knowledge that may not be contained in their parameters. This helps improve factual accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and enables the model to provide more up-to-date information."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Components",
        "content": "RAG systems typically consist of three main components: 1. A retriever that finds relevant documents based on the query. 2. An index or database of documents that can be efficiently searched. 3. A generator that produces the final output using both the query and retrieved documents."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Applications",
        "content": "RAG has become increasingly popular in applications like question-answering systems, chatbots, and knowledge-intensive tasks where factual accuracy is important."

        "heading": "What are Vector Embeddings",
        "content": "Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data objects like words, sentences, or documents in a high-dimensional vector space. These embeddings capture semantic relationships, allowing similar items to be positioned closer together in the vector space."
      },
      {
        "heading": "NLP Applications",
        "content": "In natural language processing, embedding models like Word2Vec, GloVe, and more recently, models based on transformers such as BERT and GPT, convert text into dense vector representations. These embeddings preserve semantic relationships, enabling operations like finding similar words or documents through vector similarity calculations."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Similarity Measures",
        "content": "Modern embedding techniques often use cosine similarity or dot products to measure the similarity between vectors. This allows for efficient search and retrieval of related content from large databases."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Use Cases",
        "content": "Vector embeddings form the backbone of many information retrieval systems, recommendation engines, and semantic search applications. They enable machines to understand and process language in ways that approximate human understanding of meaning and context."
